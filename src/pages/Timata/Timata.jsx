            Ever since I have used the student-platform called “Ping Pong”, I
            found it to be more complicated than than it had to be.

            <p>
            Although the second student-platform I currently use,“ITHS Distans”,
            had a much less cluttered functions and more pleasing aesthethic
            appearance, there were still some room for improvements according to
            the students who used it as well.

            This case study was inspired by the student platform called ping pong
            during a coding assignment in my frontend development education.

            We and others took the opportunity and coded the firstversion of the
            app.
